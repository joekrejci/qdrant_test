Customer wanted to implement a healthcheck into the docker compose file but the image does not contain curl. Their original proposal in the docker compose file:

  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://qdrant-database:6333/healthz"]


1. Could be solved by just adding curl to the base container, but whats the fun in that... :) 

2. I found someone via a Github Issue with a similar problem who came up with an interesting solution.


#!/bin/bash

exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/"$1"

echo -e "GET https://joey-test-instance.us-east4-0.gcp.cloud.qdrant.io:6333/healthz HTTP/1.1
host: localhost:$1
" >&3

timeout 1 cat <&3 | grep healthz | grep passed || exit 1

Basically what this does is redirect File Descriptor 3 to the specified port.

Could be ran like this: 

    healthcheck:
      test: [ 'CMD-SHELL', '/bin/bash -c "/path/to/healthcheck.sh 8081"' ]
      ...

I didn't have the time to fully test this implementation, but I think this could theoretically work with some testing and tweaks.
